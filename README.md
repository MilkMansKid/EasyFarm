# EasyFarm
EasyFarm is a general purpose farming tool for Final Fantasy XI

EasyFarm helps reduce tedious work by automating the farming process. This allows a player to concentrate on important game aspects, instead of boring, non-essential parts. Rather than relying on job specific optimizations, its general design allows for adapting to many situations and enables support all job types.

# FAQ
**Does the program detect aggro?**

Yes, the program can detect whether the player has aggro.

**Why does the new version of the program crash?**

Using an old user preference file may cause the program to crash. Delete the preference file and let the program generate a new one. 

**The program has caused my character to keeping running and I can't get him to stop. What should I do?**

Shut down the program, restart it and re-hit the start button.

**Why is the program not targeting mobs correctly or not at all?**

Try turning off the in-game auto target feature and see if that fixes the problem. 

**Can you please add feature X?**

If the feature you request is in line with the goals of the program of course but adding additional features will take some time.
